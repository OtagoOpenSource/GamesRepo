/* 
 * The placement of the player is currently determined by rotating the player
 * around the planet they are attached to. Because I wasn't sure the best way
 * to place the player and move around the planet, this was what I chose. Wasn't
 * sure if there was existing way to do this, so I am manually going the matrix
 * operations myself.
 * 
 * The current method is probably not great for jumping from planet to planet.
 * It's probably possible to adapt, but the object does't actually adhere to
 * physics. It is "stuck" to the planet surface at the chosen distance and is
 * rotated around it. When the player jumps, this is simply jump increasing the
 * distance used in the rotation operations. If we are using a grappling hook
 * to move from planet to planet, I suppose it would be possible to adapt this
 * to fit that.
